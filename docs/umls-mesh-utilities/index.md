# tdc-tools: UMLS and MeSH utilities

[Main Documentation](..)

tdc-tools contains several python script to read and manipulate the [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html) data and the [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) hierarchy.

- Map a concept id to its term (text description) and/or semantic group (UMLS)
- Extract all the concepts in a subtree of the UMLS or MeSH hierarchy, i.e. find all the concepts more specific than the input concept.
- Convert from MeSH descriptor to UMLS CUI and conversely
